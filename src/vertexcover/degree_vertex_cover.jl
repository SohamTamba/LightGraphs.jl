"""
    degree_vertex_cover(g)

Obtain a vertex cover using a greedy heuristic.

### Implementation Notes
An edge is said to be covered if it has at least one end-point in the vertex cover.
Initialise the vertex cover to an empty set and iteratively choose the vertex with the most uncovered
edges.

### Performance
Runtime: O((|V|+|E|)*log(|V|))
Memory: O(|V|)
